# Workshop-04

By: Matthew White

## Emphasis

Each online workshop will focus on *practical skills* commonly used in web development (version control, regular expressions, testing, etc). Each workshop (except Week 12) involves a skills challenge to be completed in a "follow along" manner.  Completing each challenge accounts for the student's workshop grade.  

Details of workshop challenges will only be _accessible by attending_ the workshop periods or watching the workshop recording (they will not be posted on Blackboard).

## Strong

Attendance in the workshop is **50% of the workshop grade**.  Students should ensure they are properly authenticated with Zoom so that their attendance is recorded correctly.

Workshop challenges are __marked out of 2__, with one mark for attendance and one mark for completing the challenge  (with 0.5 marks for a partially completed challenge submission).
